# Manan Sharma

Founder, [Modular Equipment](https://modequip.github.io/)

Apart from tinkering public interest projects I am a platform development consultant and system architect for stage startups helping in high level designing, mostly pro-bono.
Professionally, I build meaningful things, always with the end-user in mind. With forward-thinking, to be obsessed with good design and best practices. 

This is an age old profile. Consider this more or less dapricated. Please refer [here][1] for the latest. I am building a small time knowledge base of all what I have learned [there][1].
